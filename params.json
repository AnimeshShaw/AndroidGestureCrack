Android's pattern lock contains a SHA1 hash of the pattern in a gesture.key file in /data/system folder in the internal memory of the android. It has been tested on Android API Level 15 and up, but should work with lower versions as well. I am not exactly sure if the location of the gesture.key is same in all flavors of Android. As long as you extract the gesture.key file this tool will work well.\r\n\r\nThe key is a SHA1 hash of the sequence of bytes of the pattern. The hash is unsalted and hence very easy to crack. The code uses the dictionary which you can download from the link below:-\r\n\r\n###### [Download Dictionary](http://www.android-forensics.com/tools/AndroidGestureSHA1.rar)\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nYou need to get the gesture.key file from android hidden system folder and extract the dictionary file from link above.
